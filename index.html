        <p>Hey, I’m Kenneth, an undergraduate student. I'm lucky to be part of the <em>Global Career Accelerator</em>
          course. Through this page, let’s get a little closer — from strangers to, well, familiar strangers. Haha.
          Trust me, you’ll know me a bit better by the end.</p>
        <p>In life, our interests, experiences, and skills are often tied together. Interests lead to certain
          experiences, and within those experiences, our abilities naturally show up. So through the following examples,
          you’ll get to know what I’m into.</p>

        <p>Two years ago, I started running a content creator channel on a video platform. Then last October, while
          diving into new college courses, I realized that everything is heading toward new technology. 2025 is the age
          of AI. And today, AI has given most people access to powerful tools with no real barriers.</p>
        <p>I realized something: if you don’t have tech skills, you chase the tech. But if you <em>do</em> have the
          skills, it’s all about the content. Once tech stops being a problem, the spotlight moves to content.</p>
        <p>Original, high-quality content is incredibly important. You can repackage it, remix it, repurpose it — and
          every version you create from that becomes a valuable asset. But especially in the CS world, most people are
          just blindly copying or repurposing trendy open-source projects. That’s <em>not</em> new content.</p>
        <p>So how do you consistently produce high-quality content? That’s the question I care about — and what I’ve
          been working on for the past two years.</p>

      <div class="section-right">
        <p>I love writing bot scripts. It feels like I’ve got an army of obedient clones doing my work. It honestly
          gives me that “overlord” feeling. Bots boost my productivity by tens or even hundreds of times. That’s why I
          can execute ideas so quickly.</p>
        <p>Even if a bot moves as slowly as a human, it doesn’t get tired. I can put the task in motion, step away to
          rest, and the work keeps going. It doesn’t stop.</p>
        <p>Last week, I found that posting ads in Discord communities gave me a conversion rate of 17% — which is
          insane. But messages get buried fast in those chats, and I didn’t have time to keep posting manually. So I
          wrote a bot that auto-rotates my past article copy, assembles them dynamically, and posts them on intervals.
          The result? A 20–25% increase in traffic. Unreal.</p>

      <div class="section-right">
        <p>There’s a real difference between a webpage and a full website. Once you have multiple pages, all kinds of
          new problems show up. How do you organize the structure? How do you design a scalable system?</p>
        <p>About a year ago, I got into websites. I’ve built three gaming encyclopedias, the biggest of which has over
          7,000 pages. SMW (Semantic MediaWiki) turned out to be a powerful and efficient tool — it lets you query page
          data and generate new content. It’s a game-changer for productivity and makes ongoing maintenance much easier.

    <section id="users" class="section">
      <div class="section-left">
        <h1>Users</h1>
        <img src="img/AB Testing.png" alt="Users" />
      </div>
      <div class="section-right">
        <p>We often talk about UX. To me, UX is really just about how well you understand your users.</p>
        <p>In reality, most users have only two traits: they’re dumb and lazy.</p>
        <p>Their ability to comprehend things is <em>shockingly</em> low. Every time I design a feature, I go in with
          one mindset — even a kid should be able to use this. Don’t expect users to understand <em>you</em>; instead,
          you have to <em>think like them</em>. How will <em>they</em> act? What will <em>they</em> do?</p>
        <p>Almost no user is willing to take extra steps. I optimized the site structure so that 99% of all content is
          reachable in two clicks and two scrolls — max. I bought a three-letter domain name just so users wouldn’t be
          too lazy to type it. I applied for whitelists on every major platform so that when people click my links, they
          don’t have to jump through extra redirects.</p>
        <p>And then there’s the wild variety of devices people use — desktops, phones, iPads, smartwatches, even car
          navigation screens. Not joking. One visitor <em>actually</em> accessed the site from a car screen. That’s when
          you really start thinking about responsive design and compatibility — even with ancient Android.</p>

    <section id="data" class="section">
      <div class="section-left">
        <h1>Data</h1>
        <img src="img/Binary code.png" alt="Data" />
      </div>
      <div class="section-right">
        <p>Earlier I mentioned how I made encyclopedia sites for three games by MY.GAMES B.V. . But truth is, I’m not
          good at
          games — and I don’t even enjoy playing them.</p>
        <p>So how do you write 7,000 detailed entries if you don’t play?</p>
        <p>Unpack the data.</p>
        <p>I decoded binary data files into readable text. I took 1.8 million lines of deeply nested and chaotic JSON,
          reconstructed the structure with Python, cleaned it, and built a local database. Using that, I generated web
          pages with JS scripts and styled them into clean entries using SMW templates.</p>
        <p>Anyone can download unpacking software, but why, can some people only get images out of it, while I can
          extract full structured data and build entire websites?</p>
        <p>Because I spent a full semester systematically learning the Unity engine — and half a year understanding
          Unreal Engine 5. I know the file structures inside and out. I’ve unpacked <em>a lot</em>. And that experience
          made all the difference.</p>
